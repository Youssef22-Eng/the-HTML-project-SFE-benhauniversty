    <h1>Integrating the approaches</h1> 
    <p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent">intelligent agent</a>  is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as firms). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given "goal function". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works—some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"> artificial neural networks</a> and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields—such as decision theory and economics—that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.[188]
    <h2> Agent architectures and cognitive architectures</h2> 
     Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi-agent system.[189] A hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modeling.[190] Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as Soar, are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern extensions of Soar are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_intelligent_system">hybrid intelligent systems</a>  that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.[97][191]
